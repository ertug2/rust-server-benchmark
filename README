This is a basic harmony-mod based performance benchmark for the Rust game server. This includes the Windows and Linux version and is made for the staging build (13005895) of the Rust dedicated server files. That build of the server files are included.

This harmony-mod plugin is made by @bmgjet, it also includes documentation on how to use below.

Steps to run benchmark:

1.) Get a dedicated server, VPS or computer.

2.) Download latest 7z release archive of this for your operating system, ([Windows]:(https://github.com/gmc-hosting/rust-server-benchmark/releases/download/v1.0.0/benchmark2023_windows.7z), [Linux]:(https://github.com/gmc-hosting/rust-server-benchmark/releases/download/v1.0.0/benchmark2023_linux.7z))

3.) Extract the 7z archive into a folder

You may do this on Debian via:

```
apt-get install p7zip-full
7z x benchmark2023_linux.7z
```

4.) If you already ran the benchmark then delete the .sav and .map folders generated

5.) Go into the extracted folder and run the benchmark with 8192 map world size. You may do so via either running [Bench]3_Hard-12.5GB-208.bat (Windows) or bench_3_Hard-12.5GB-208.sh (Linux) via the commands below:


```
chmod +x bench_3_Hard-12.5GB-208.sh
./bench_3_Hard-12.5GB-208.sh
```

   -  This will generate a bench log file once finished testing the server which will have your results in it. Give it to @bmgjet or somebody to graph it out and compare your results with others.

6.) Profit.
